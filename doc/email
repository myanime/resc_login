Hi Matt,
Here is the script for doing Generic Logons and Registrations for sites in a
MongoDB Collection.

The script uses Chrome Driver, the driver I have included is for Linux, have a
bit of a search if you need it on a Mac or windows.
https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/

I changed the schema of your database slightly I added a field for the checkbox
in the register section. If you import the rescator_schema document to mongo,
the script should work.

The captcha is being solved by OCR, but I put in a method for solving using
decaptcha (I have not implemented it however)

There are still a few thing that need to be fixed up, I wrote about in in the
readme.txt file, but specifically:
    1. Error Handling
    2. Database schema needs some fields added, to make the script more generic

For me to work on this it would be helpful if I had 2 or 3 other sites to use
as inputs.

I spent all Saturday on this script, it took 14 hours (I worked also today a bit)
I would say it needs about another 4-6 hours of work.

Let me know your thoughts.
